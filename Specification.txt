Using window.localStorage, need to check security issue

Introducing Redux, whilst complex at first, is very helpful, also cleaner code

using hooks with functional components over class - much much cleaner code

issue with reducer overwriting state of another reducer - the issue was in the reducer, instead of return ...state in default switch case section, I was return initialState.


issue of undefined localStorage object on refresh - turned out, was calling login on refresh, without username/password, in doing so, overwriting token with undefined. fixed by creating new action for authenticateOnRefresh

issue of routes not matching to paths - issue was having multiple routers in app - only need one!! then it doesn't matter where you declare your routes - declare them where you want your component
